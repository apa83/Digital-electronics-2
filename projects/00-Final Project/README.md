## Introduction

"4-sides-poker-timer", 
* This project is about a counter of the time left in the current player's turn in a poker game.
* The principal idea was to display the time on 2 to 3 sides of the cube (But we were able to display the counter on one side only).
* Using an easy design control by 2 push buttons. 
* The time is displayed using minutes and seconds separated by two colons using a count down option.
